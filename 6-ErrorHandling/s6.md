# JavaScript Errors: Throw and Try-Catch Summary ⚙️

When writing JavaScript code, errors are bound to happen. These errors may stem from programming mistakes, incorrect input, or issues with the program's logic. JavaScript equips developers with five key statements to manage errors effectively:

## 1. try Statement
   - Tests a block of code for errors.

## 2. catch Statement
   - Handles errors and responds to exceptions.

## 3. throw Statement
   - Creates custom errors, allowing developers to throw their own exceptions.

## 4. finally Statement
   - Executes code after the try and catch blocks, running regardless of the block's result.

These statements provide a robust error-handling mechanism in JavaScript development. ⚙️
