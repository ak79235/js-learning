# JavaScript Basics Overview

## Syntax 📘
JavaScript syntax guides code construction, including instructions for output, variables, and computations.

## Variables 📦
JavaScript variables store data, with local (block or function) and global (outside function or window object) scopes.

## Operators 🚀
JavaScript operators perform operations on operands, with arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and assignment (`=`, `+=`, `%=`) operators.

## Expressions 🎨
JavaScript expressions combine values, operators, and variables to compute values.

## Keywords 📝
JavaScript keywords are reserved words with specific meanings, such as 'let' for variable declaration and 'function' for creating functions.

## Comments 💬
JavaScript comments, whether single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* */`), enhance code readability without affecting execution.

## Data Types 📊
JavaScript supports various data types, including primitive (strings, numbers, booleans) and non-primitive (arrays, objects) types.

## Functions 🛠️
JavaScript functions are reusable code blocks for specific operations, executed upon being called.

These fundamental concepts in JavaScript lay the groundwork for dynamic and interactive web applications.
