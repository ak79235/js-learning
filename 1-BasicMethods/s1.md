# JavaScript Output Methods 🚀

Each of the mentioned JavaScript methods has distinct ways of displaying content:

## 1. `document.write()` ✏️

The `document.write()` function is employed to output content directly onto the HTML document. It is commonly used to dynamically generate content within the HTML document itself.

## 2. `console.log()` 🖥️

The `console.log()` method is primarily utilized for debugging JavaScript code. Developers use it to log messages, variables, or any information to the browser's console. This aids in inspecting and tracing the execution of the code during development.

## 3. `alert()` 🔔

The `alert()` function serves the purpose of presenting an alert box on the browser window. It is often used to convey important messages or warnings to the user. However, excessive use of alerts can be disruptive to the user experience.

These methods offer different ways to interact with and communicate information within the context of a web page. 🌐
